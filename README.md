# Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Logging Data Source

## Introduction

Grafana is a popular technology that makes it easy to visualize metrics and logs.
The OCI Logging Grafana Plugin can be used to extend Grafana by adding
[Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Logging][1] as a data source in Grafana.

The plugin allows you to retrieve logs related to a number of resources on
Oracle Cloud: Compute, Networking, Storage, custom logs from your application,
and audit logs generated by Oracle Cloud services. Once these logs are in Grafana,
they can be analysed along with metrics, giving you a single pane of glass for your
application monitoring needs.

For custom logs from your application, see [Custom Logging on OCI][2].
## Prerequisites

We will discuss two different Grafana IAM configurations that needs to be in
place, for Grafana to fetch the logs from Oracle Cloud Logging Service.

### For local/dev box environment

#### Install the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure CLI

The [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure CLI][3] provides you with a way to perform
tasks in OCI from your command line rather than the OCI Console. It does so by
making REST calls to the [OCI APIs][4]. We will be using the CLI to authenticate
between our local environment hosting Grafana and OCI in order to pull in
log content. The CLI is built on Python (version 2.7.5 or 3.6 or later), running on
macOS, Windows, or Linux.

Begin by [installing the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure CLI][5]. Follow the
installation prompts to install the CLI on your local environment. After the
installation is complete, use the `oci setup config` command to have the CLI
walk you through the first-time setup process. If you haven't already uploaded
your public API signing key through the console, [follow these instructions][6]
to do so.

#### Configure OCI Identity Policies

In the OCI console under **Identity > Groups** click **Create Group** and create
a new group called **GrafanaLoggingUserGroup**. Add the user configured in the
OCI CLI to the newly-created group.

Under the **Policy** tab switch to the root compartment and click **Create Policy**.
Create a policy allowing the group to read tenancy log groups and log content. Add the following
policy statements:

- `allow group GrafanaLoggingUserGroup to read log-groups in tenancy`
- `allow group GrafanaLoggingUserGroup to read log-content in tenancy`
- `allow group GrafanaLoggingUserGroup to read compartments in tenancy`

### For compute-instance/VM on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure

#### Create Dynamic Group for your instance

Provision an Oracle Linux [virtual machine][7] in OCI connected to a
[Virtual Cloud Network][8] with access to the public internet. If you do not
already have access to a Virtual Cloud Network with access to the public
internet you can navigate to **Virtual Cloud Networks** under **Networking** and
click **Create Virtual Cloud Network**. Choosing the
`CREATE VIRTUAL CLOUD NETWORK PLUS RELATED RESOURCES` option will result in a
VCN with an Internet Routing Gateway and Route Tables configured for access to
the public internet. Three subnets will be created: one in each availability
domain in the region.

After creating your VM, the next step is to create a [dynamic group][9] used to
group virtual machine or bare metal compute instances as “principals” (similar
to user groups).

You can define the dynamic group similar to below, where your instance is part
of the compartment given in the definition of the dynamic group.

#### Create IAM policy for Dynamic Group for your instance

Next, create a [policy][10] named “grafana_policy” in the root compartment of
your tenancy to permit instances in the dynamic group to make API calls against
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services. Add the following policy statements:

- `allow dynamicgroup DynamicGroupForGrafanaInstances to read log-groups in tenancy`
- `allow dynamicgroup DynamicGroupForGrafanaInstances to read log-content in tenancy`
- `allow dynamicgroup DynamicGroupForGrafanaInstances to read compartments in tenancy`
