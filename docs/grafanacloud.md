# Grafana Cloud Installation - Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Source for Grafana

## Background

Grafana is a popular technology that makes it easy to visualize metrics. The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Source for Grafana is used to extend Grafana by adding OCI as a data source. The plugin enables you to visualize metrics related to several OCI resources: Compute, Networking, Storage, and custom metrics.

This walkthrough is intended for use by people who would like to deploy Grafana and the OCI Data Source for Grafana in **Grafana Cloud**.

Make sure you have access to the [Monitoring Service](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Concepts/monitoringoverview.htm) and that [metrics have been enabled](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/enablingmonitoring.htm) for the resources you are trying to monitor.

## Getting OCI Configuration values

To configure OCI Metrics Grafana Data Source, you'll need to get the necessary provider and resource settings. Please note that with **Grafana Cloud** only version 4.x.x and above are supported. If you are configuring the plugin to work in Multitenancy Mode, you will need to repeat the following steps for each of the Tenancies you want to configure with the plugin (up to 5 additional Tenancies are supported).

### Getting the Region

To get the region for your OCI cloud, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the OCI console.
2. From the OCI menu, select the **Region** dropdown in the top right corner of the page.
3. The region is listed next to **Home**.

For details and reference, see: [Regions and Availability Domains](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm#top)
Make note of the region as you'll need it later to configure your OCI Metrics Grafana Data Source.

### Getting the Tenancy OCID

To get the tenancy OCID, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the OCI console.
2. From the OCI menu, click on your profile icon on the top right:

For details and reference, see: [Where to Get the Tenancy's OCID and User's OCID](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#five)
Make note of the tenancy OCID as you'll need it later to configure your OCI Metrics Grafana Data Source.

### Getting the User OCID

To get the user OCID, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the OCI console.
2. From the OCI menu, select **Identity** > **Users**.
3. Click on the user you want to use with OCI Metrics Grafana Data Source.
4. The user OCID is listed in the **User Details** section.

For details and reference, see: [Where to Get the Tenancy's OCID and User's OCID](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#five).
Make note of the user OCID as you'll need it later to configure your OCI Metrics Grafana Data Source.

### Getting the Private API Key and Fingerprint

To get the private key, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your **OCI tenancy** and click on your username in the top right corner.
2. Go to **Resources** and **API Keys** and click on **Add API Key**.
3. Choose if you want to generate a new API key or use your own:
    - Select **Generate API Key Pair** if you want to generate a new API key. Click then on **Download Private Key** and **Download Public Key** to get your newly generated key
    - Select **Public Key File** or **Paste Public Key** in case you want to paste your public key: select **Paste Public Key** in the **Add API Key** dialog and copy and paste the key contents into the field, then click **Add**.

For details on how to create and configure keys see [How to Generate an API Signing Key](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#two) and [How to Upload the Public Key](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#three).
Make note of the private key file location and API key fingerprint as you'll need it later to configure your OCI Metrics Grafana Data Source.


## Configure OCI Identity Policies

In the OCI console under **Identity > Groups** click **Create Group** and create a new group called **grafana**. Add the user configured in the OCI CLI to the newly-created group.

Under the **Policy** tab click **Create Policy** and create a policy allowing the group to read tenancy metrics. Add the following policy statements:

- `allow group grafana to read metrics in tenancy`
- `allow group grafana to read compartments in tenancy`

You can then choose between two different modes as **Tenancy mode**:

* **single**: to use a single specific Tenancy
* **multitenancy**: to use multiple tenancies

### Configure Plugin in Single Tenancy Mode
If you selected **single** as **Tenancy mode** then fill in the following credentials:

* `Profile Name` - A user-defined name for this profile. In **single** mode this is automatically set to **DEFAULT** and cannot be modified.
* `Region` - An OCI region. To get the value, see [**Getting Region Configuration value**](#getting-the-region).
* `User OCID` - OCID of the user calling the API. To get the value, see [**Getting User OCID Configuration value**](#getting-the-user-OCID).* 
* `Tenancy OCID` - OCID of your tenancy. To get the value, see [**Getting Tenancy OCID Configuration value**](#getting-the-tenancy-OCID).
* `Fingerprint` - Fingerprint for the key pair being used. To get the value, see [**Getting Fingerprint Configuration value**](#getting-the-private-api-key-and-fingerprint).
* `Private Key` - The contents of the private key file. To get the value, see [**Getting Private Key Configuration value**](#getting-the-private-api-key-and-fingerprint).

The configured data source will look like the following:

![Datasource Filled](images/datasource_conf_filled.png)

Click **Save & Test** to return to the home dashboard.


### Configure Plugin in Multi-Tenancy Mode
If you selected **multi** as **Tenancy mode** then fill in the following credentials for **each Tenancy you want to configure (up to 5 additional tenancies)**:

* `Profile Name` - A user-defined name for this profile. The first Tenancy is automatically set to **DEFAULT** and cannot be modified. You need to specify a custom and unique Profile name for each of the additional tenancies.
* `Region` - An OCI region. To get the value, see [**Getting Region Configuration value**](#getting-the-region).
* `User OCID` - OCID of the user calling the API. To get the value, see [**Getting User OCID Configuration value**](#getting-the-user-OCID).
* `Tenancy OCID` - OCID of your tenancy. To get the value, see [**Getting Tenancy OCID Configuration value**](#getting-the-tenancy-OCID).
* `Fingerprint` - Fingerprint for the key pair being used. To get the value, see [**Getting Fingerprint Configuration value**](#getting-the-private-api-key-and-fingerprint).
* `Private Key` - The contents of the private key file. To get the value, see [**Getting Private Key Configuration value**](#getting-the-private-api-key-and-fingerprint).

By default, if you selected **multi** as **Tenancy mode** you can configure one DEFAULT tenancy with an additional one. You may add others tenancy **(up to 5 additional tenancies)** using the **Add another Tenancy** checkbox.

The configured data source will look like the following:
